# Antipado-portfolio

2. Reflection

The most significant challenge I faced while building this portfolio was a purely technical one: creating the website and managing its deployment entirely from my phone. Specifically, I encountered errors when trying to upload my local folder to GitHub using `git` commands within Termux. The combination of a mobile-only environment and command-line interfaces led to some frustrating initial roadblocks.

My solution relied heavily on leveraging technology to fix technology. I used AI tools by copying the specific error messages I encountered in the terminal and pasting them into an AI chat for analysis. This approach allowed me to quickly diagnose the root causes, learn the correct syntax for the specific mobile setup, and successfully push my code to the remote repository. This experience proved the value of using available resources to troubleshoot and overcome limitations imposed by my current development setup.

Looking ahead, my immediate focus for improving the portfolio is on enhancing both its technical foundation and design quality. I plan to significantly upskill in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript to move beyond basic structures and create a more dynamic, responsive, and professional user experience. Beyond code, I will adopt a more deliberate design process. Before touching the text editor, I will carefully think of a design and possibly create a simple wireframe or mockup to ensure the layout is clean, user-friendly, and effectively showcases my work. This strategic planning will lead to a more polished and impactful final product.
